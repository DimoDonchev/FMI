You are trapped in a 2D Dungeon and need to find the quickest way out! The dungeon is composed of unit cubes which may or may not be filled with rock.
It takes one minute to move one unit north, south, east, west. You cannot move diagonally and maze is surrounded with solid rock on all sides.
Is an escape possible? If yes, how long will it take?
