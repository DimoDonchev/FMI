The Depth First Search (DFS) is the most fundamental search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It runs with a time complexity of O(V+E) and is often used as a building block in other algorithms.
By itself the DFS isn't all that useful, but when augmented to perform other tasks such as count connected components, determine connectivity, or find bridges/articulation points then DFS really shines.
